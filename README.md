<h2 align='center'>Motivation</h2>
<p align='center'>
We all are completely dependent on Gmail like applications. When such services are down we face a lot of trouble, also privacy is issue of concern now-a-days. 
Thus, our project helps building single page, highly customizable and scalable mail service with complete control over privacy for an particular organization.
<br>

</p>

------------------------------------------
### Why does the application looks similar to Gmail?
<p>
  After knowing that Whatsapp was going to change it's Privacy Policies, It was expected that users would start using alternatives like Signal/Hike but that wasn't the case.
  Analyzing Signal/Hike vs Whatsapp situation, Users don't tend to accept the changes because users were used to UI they were using since long. 
  Thus, we tried to keep the UI as similar as Gmail.
